#The elements of a vector must all have the same mode, or data type. You
#can have a vector consisting of three character strings (of mode character)
#or three integer elements (of mode integer), but not a vector with one integer element and two character string elements.


# Data Types in R - 
# Vector, List, Matrix, Array, Factor, Data Frame
data()
data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
# Vector - contains elements of same class
#A vector, in programming, is a type of array that is one dimensional. 
#Vectors are a logical element in programming languages that are used for storing data.
#Vectors are similar to arrays but their actual implementation and operation differs
#Vectors are primarily used within the programming context of most programming languages
#and serve as data structure containers. Being a data structure,
#vectors are used for storing objects and collections of objects in an 
#organized structure.


#The major difference between and array and a vector is that, unlike typical arrays, 
#the container size of a vector can be easily increased and decreased to complement 
#different data storage types. Vectors have a dynamic structure and provide the ability 
#to assign container size up front and enable allocation of memory space quickly.
#Vectors can be thought of as dynamic arrays.
# there are 6 types of these atomic vectors, also known as 6 classes of vectors which are
#Logical, Numeric, Interger, Complex, Character, Raw

## Lists
#list is an object consisting of an ordered collection of objects known as its 
#components.
#There is no particular need for the components to be of the same mode or type, and, for
#example, a list could consist of a numeric vector, a logical value, a matrix, a complex vector, a
#character array, a function, and so on. Here is a simple example of how to make a list:

Lst <- list(name = c("Fred","Jhonny"), wife=c("Mary","Anna"), no.children=c(3,5),
            child.ages=c(4,7,9,10,15))
Lst
Lst[[4]]
Lst[[4]][3]

# we can also do the above indexing by using the inbuilt functionality of list
# such as 
Lst$name
Lst$wife
Lst$child.ages
# this can also be done as 
Lst[["name"]]

x <- "name"
Lst[[x]]

#It is very important to distinguish Lst[[1]] from Lst[1]. '[[...]]' is the operator
#used
#to select a single element, whereas '[...]' is a general subscripting operator.
#Thus the former is the first object in the list Lst, and if it is a named list 
#the name is not included. 
#The latter is a sublist of the list Lst consisting of the first entry only.
#If it is a named list, the names are transferred to the sublist.

# we will look into built in function of R such as apply(), lapply(), sapply(),tapply()
# functions
## apply()

# apply() functions matrix or Dataframe as input and provides output as vector, list or array
# apply() function is primarly used to avoid loop constructs. 
# apply() function takes three arguments such as
#apply(X,MARGIN,FUN) 
# where in X is a matrix or Dataframe
# Margin takes values as 1 and 2 which helps to define on where to apply function
# MARGIN = 1 manipulation is performed on rows
# MARGIN = 2 manipulation is performed on columns
# MARGIN = c(1,2) manipulation is performed on both Rows and columns
# FUN = tells which function to apply, built in funtions like mean, median, sum, min,
# max, and even user defined functions can also be applied

# for example lets considers a matrix and apply column sum on it
m1 <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 6)
m1
a_m1 <- apply(m1, 2, sum)

# lapply is used to perform operations on list objects and return list object of same
# length as of original set. lapply() takes input as list, dataframe, vector and provides
# as list
# arguments of lapply() function are 
# lapply(X, FUN)
#x is vector /list / datafram
# FUN is function 

# for example if we want to convert a list of string uppercase elements to lowercase
# we use lapply() to do it at once
#tolower is inbuilt functions

# tapply() computes a measure (mean, median, min, max, etc..) or a function for
# each factor variable in a vector. It is a very useful function that lets you 
# create a subset of a vector and then apply some functions to each of the subset.
# arguments of tapply() are 
# tapply(X, INDEX, FUN)
# X = an object, dataframe or vector
# INDEX = A list containing factor
# FUN = Functions that we want to apply such as mean, median, sum

# for example we will load a dataset called as iris
